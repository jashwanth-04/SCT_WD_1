As part of my web development internship, I have created an interactive navigation menu using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This menu features dynamic styling changes when scrolled or when a menu item is hovered over. It maintains a fixed position and remains visible across all pages. HTML was utilized to structure the menu, CSS to style it, and JavaScript to add interactivity, such as altering the background or font color upon scrolling or hovering over menu items.
